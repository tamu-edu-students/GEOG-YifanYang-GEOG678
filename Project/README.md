Project Description: 

Our project is an interactive web-based map that visualizes safety features across the Texas A&M campus—such as emergency call boxes, security cameras, lighting, and pedestrian traffic—using layered data and a weighted heatmap to help students navigate more safely and support campus planning decisions.

Feature Overview:

Our webmap uses Leaflet JS with an OpenStreetMap basemap to implement our map.The map uses 4 feature layers from that were manually collected and uploaded using ArcGIS. They include 4 safety categories: 

* Emergency Phone Boxes
* Security Cameras
* High Foot Traffic Routes
* Poorly Lit Areas

In terms of Features we've added the search feature that allows you to find the location as well as popups that show the attribute details of markers. We've implemented custom icons. We've also implemented layer control so the user can toggle visibility of each safety layer As well as a legend.
