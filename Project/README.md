Project Description: 

Our project is an interactive web-based map that visualizes safety features across the Texas A&M campus—such as emergency call boxes, security cameras, lighting, and pedestrian traffic—using layered data and a weighted heatmap to help students navigate more safely and support campus planning decisions.

Feature Overview:

Our webmap uses Leaflet JS with an OpenStreetMap basemap to implement our map. The map uses 4 feature layers that were manually collected and uploaded using ArcGIS Field Maps and ArcGIS Online. They include 4 safety categories: 

* Emergency Phone Boxes
* Security Cameras
* High Foot Traffic Routes
* Poorly Lit Areas

In terms of Features we've added: 

* A search Box to find specific locations
* Popups that show the attribute details of markers
* A legend with custom icons
* Layer control that allows the user to toggle visibility of each safety layer
